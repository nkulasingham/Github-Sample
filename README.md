# Gitgazers

Gitgazers is an MIT Licensed Github explorer that uses uses React, Redux and Apollo to view repos from people.

Gitgazers is built upon the excellent [ReactQL](https://reactql.org/) starter kit. I've used this particular starter kit over coding my own webpack configuration because:

1. This starter kit is exceptionally well documented and maintained
2. It uses the latest and best practises in the industry
3. It saves me time from having to reinvent the wheel specifically for this project
4. I've used this starter kit in production before and have contributed contributions to this kit via issues and pull requests that have been either resolved or accepted.


## Project Structure

For this project everything not in ./src can be considered kit code so if you'd like to inspect my code, please use the ./src file unless stated otherwise.
